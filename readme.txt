The objective of the Cardiovascular Disease Prediction project is to forecast
the likelihood of cardiovascular disease onset in patients using their medical
data and medical history. Through an analysis of diverse factors, the project
determines the chances of cardiovascular disease emerging in a patient. This
predictive model serves as a significant resource for pinpointing individuals
with elevated risk levels, facilitating timely intervention.
